## Accouncement: Upcoming Meetup

[Chicago Dava Visualization Community](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Data-Viz-Community) will be hosting an [event this Wednesday](https://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Data-Viz-Community/events/257723997/). 

*****About the Talk*****

What makes a style guide effective? Why are they useful? How style guides apply to data visualization? This talk outlines the differences between a style guide and a template, and why organizations should have both. I will share insights into the goals, tone and creation process of a style guide for data visualization, using both the Sunlight Foundation and CFPB style guides as case studies.

## D3 Blueprint
As you've probably noticed, plots (especially common plots like bar, scatter, line, etc.) will often start the same way with similar starter steps. I want you all to take a moment now to think through all the steps necessary for creating a plot. This is something you can then use in the future when starting new. 

Collaborate with your classmates and add the steps to [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12V8c9BRft1uhFFTjg9c0sAucCfVVyho63fIsQqk8gdg/edit?usp=sharing). This is something you can look back on when reminding yourself where to start.

## Scatter Plot with New Data

I've added a new dataset that includes January 2019 data. Let's look at what this does to the plot we created. (You don't need to follow along for this, but if you'd like, you can find the new data in the `general Update Pattern` folder.)

## General Update Pattern Talk

We'll go through the basics of the general update  pattern in [this talk](https://github.com/molliemarie/SharedSlides/blob/master/General_Update_Pattern.pdf). 

## General Update Pattern Tutorial

Now, you'll get some practice playing around with the `enter`, `exit`, and `update` selections in [this General Update Pattern tutorial](/Projects&Exercises/generalUpdatePattern/genUpdatePattern_StarTrekLab.md).

## Add General Update  Pattern to Line / Scatter Plot

Take what you've learned about the general update function and apply it to the scatter / line plot we made previously so that it doesn't break when adding data for an incomplete year. Instructions [here](/Projects&Exercises/generalUpdatePattern/). 

## TreeMap 

Learn about hierarchy, `d3.nest`, and build your first TreeMap [here](/Projects&Exercises/TreeMap/)!

## Before Next Class

We have just one more class left. If there is something specific that you're having trouble with or that you'd like to learn more about, ping me on slack and let me know!

I'll poll the class about how far they got in their treemap in the event you need more time on that.
